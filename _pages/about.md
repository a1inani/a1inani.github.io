I'm Alinani Simukanga, a Lecturer and researcher in Computer Science based in Lusaka, Zambia. I specialize in cybersecurity, AI/ML, software engineering, and ICT for development. In my teaching role at the University of Edenberg, I lead courses from Python programming to operating systems and algorithms. My work in projects like Project SEARCH, which leverages biometric tools for health applications, reflects my commitment to tech solutions grounded in real-world impact. Outside the classroom, I publish on topics like ear biometrics, e-governance systems, and secure systems. Letâ€™s connect! View my research, projects or reach out.
