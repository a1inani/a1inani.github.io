I've got a bit of time on my hands, and the last few blog posts are proof that I have been looking for something to keep me busy. A couple of days ago, I thought "What if I built a small database in Python?". I've been teaching a course in Python programming the last few semesters, so I'm far from rusty in the language. Plus it would present a decent optimization challenge I can hopefully throw some algorithms and data structures at further down the line. 

Now, it all sounds great in theory, but I have never built a database before. Where would I even begin. So I reached for an LLM (ChatGPT in this case), and asked it to generate a roadmap highlighting key concepts that need to be implemented.

#### We'll call it FoundryDB

##### Phase 1 Objectives
Implement a **minimal persistent storage layer** for FoundryDB, capable of:
- Writing table rows to disk
- Reading all rows sequentially
- Surviving restarts
- Exposing a simple programmatic API (`insert`, `scan`)

No SQL parsing, indexing, or transactions yet.

##### Architecture Overview
Database
├── Catalog → stores schema metadata (catalog.meta)
├── StorageEngine → manages .tbl files (JSON-lines)
└── Foundries/ → directory holding table files

##### Components
 Module | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| `foundrydb.database` | Orchestrates catalog and storage; entry point for REPL and tests |
| `foundrydb.storage` | Handles file I/O (`insert`, `scan`) |
| `foundrydb.catalog` | Maintains metadata stub (created in Phase 1) |
| `foundrydb.cli` | Simple interactive shell |
| `tests/` | Pytest suite verifying insert/scan/persistence |

##### File Format
- One `.tbl` file per table, stored under the database path  
- Each line = one row (JSON object)

Example `users.tbl`
```json
{"id":1,"name":"Alice"}
{"id":2,"name":"Bob"}
```

##### StorageEngine API
```python
storage = StorageEngine("foundries/demo")
storage.insert("users", {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"})
for row in storage.scan("users"):
    print(row)

```

##### Database Class
- Initializes Catalog + StorageEngine
- Provides .execute() stub for later SQL handling
```python
db = Database("foundries/demo")
db.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES {'id':1,'name':'Alice'};")
db.execute("SELECT * FROM users;")

```

#### Lessons & Decisions
- Format: JSON-lines for human readability & ease of testing
- No schema validation yet: will arrive in Phase 3 (Catalog expansion)
- Append-only writes: simpler recovery and safe for Phase 1
- Error handling: breaks on corrupted lines gracefully
- Next: build a basic SQL parser for SELECT and WHERE clauses

#### Next Phase: Simple Query Language (Phase 2)
Goals:
- Hand-rolled SQL parser (SELECT, WHERE)
- Expression evaluation
- Query execution via full table scan
- More formal AST and error handling
