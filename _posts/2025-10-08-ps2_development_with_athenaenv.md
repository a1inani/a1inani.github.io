For the better part of a year, I've been enamoured by the idea of doing full on game development. About a decade ago I tinkered around in Unity (and Blender), under the guidance of a YouTube playlist. I built one simple game and my interest ended there. A couple of years later, I got my hands on a Phat PAL PS2 (enter model number here) and a FreeMcBoot memory card. This got me thinking, what if I gave PS2 game development a try? What is it like to write game code that runs on bare metal? No operating system or hypervisor to run on top of.

So I set out in search of the PS2 SDK and stumbled upon a preconfigured Docker container (ps2dev/ps2dev). I searched for a tutorial on YouTube and I was off to the races, writing C++ code for the first time in quite a while. I didn't get too far along in this process, and frankly I didn't know what was going on most of the time, so I shelved it a couple of weeks in.

By chance, I saw a YouTube video that described the process of converting a web-based game (written in JavaScript) to run on a PS2 relying on the AthenaEnv platform. This got me longing to give PS2 development a shot once more, this time without having to worry about the complexity of C++ development. So here we are.

#### What is AthenaEnv?
